# Tic Tac Toe - AI with Minimax Algorithm

This is a **Tic Tac Toe** game implemented using **JavaScript** and **p5.js**, where the computer opponent is powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, making it unbeatable.

## Features

- **Single-player Mode:** Play against a perfect AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm.
- **Responsive Design:** The game works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth UI:** Built with p5.js to provide a clean and responsive gaming experience.
- **Unbeatable AI:** The AI always finds the optimal move using the Minimax algorithm, making it impossible to lose.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Library:** p5.js
- **Algorithm:** Minimax

## Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive function that simulates all possible moves in the Tic Tac Toe game and chooses the one that maximizes the player's chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances. This ensures that the AI plays optimally and can't be defeated.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blowsthunder/AI_Powered-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.git
